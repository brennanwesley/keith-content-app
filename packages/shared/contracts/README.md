# Shared Contracts

This folder contains shared request/response and domain contract types used by frontend and backend.

Initial Day 1 scaffold includes:
- `common.ts`: account and API envelope shapes
- `health.ts`: backend health response contract
- `content.ts`: content tag + video summary contracts

Keep these contracts implementation-agnostic and version with API changes.
